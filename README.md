In this task I have done CRUD operation using different rest apis in React.js  and do some more stuff.

## Let's Look into the app
Open [https://api-s-crud-operations-using-react-js.vercel.app/](https://api-s-crud-operations-using-react-js.vercel.app/) to view it in your browser.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]().

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
